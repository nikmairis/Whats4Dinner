# Whats4Dinner
App that helps you decide what to cook for dinner

The app is using googles Firebase services for authorisation and data storing.

The app supports full functionality of creating an account with email/password, sending "forgot password" emails and logging in.
A database reference is created for each registered user where he can store his recipes.

After logging in you can roll the dice to randomly choose one of your recipes to cook for dinner tonight.
